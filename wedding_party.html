            <p>The Unicorn Princess Twin - Shelley met Lexi one fateful night only two years ago. Shelley brought wine to a bible study group Lexi was in, together they played a rousing game of Quelf, and the rest is history. After two wonderful years of being in the same bible study group, Shelley has consistently been an encouragement to Lexi, both in her spiritual walk and her fashion sense. Now roommates, Shelley and Lexi enjoy lounging together in their matching unicorn onesies, and rejoicing in the sisterhood that God has blessed them with.</p>

            <p>The Conjoined Queen - After meeting at Northwestern and bonding over classy wine dates on Friday nights (Kathryn usually being the classy one), Kathryn and Lexi have since been inseparable. Literally. Whether living in the same house or just within the same apartment complex, Kathryn has shared a roof with Lexi for the past four years. Needless to say, this has made for many a girls' night of yummy food, movies, prayers, and stories of how God is moving and working in their lives (and, of course, more wine).</p>

            <p>The Classic Frenemy - The first time Alex saw Lexi in 10th grade Geometry class, she heard Lexi laugh and hated her immediately (Alex specifically wanted to emphasize this point of hatred). Luckily, through God's gracious humor, Alex and Lexi went on to bond over Speech and Debate and eventually became BFFs. When Lexi came to Christ in college, Alex was one of the first people to rejoice with Lexi, and despite being miles and miles apart, they have continued to speak God's love over one another ever since.</p>

Nevertheless, after years of heartfelt conversations (not to mention some ridiculously goofy ones as well), and being miles apart during college, Helen has finally relented and now allows Lexi to hug her freely. She even drops an occasional "love you" in conversations!</p>

            <p>The Original Boochi - Wai Yan and Lexi have not seen each other since high school (which is really quite crazy to think about). And yet, somehow, their high school bonds over Speech and Debate, stressful AP classes, Student Government, boy drama, and (of course) Hello Kitty have stood the test of time. Their affection for one another cannot be summed up by any known words, and so they have had to coin their own pet name: they lovingly refer to one another simply as "Boochi".</p>
